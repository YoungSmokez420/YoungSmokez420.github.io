        <h2>My Practice Web Browser</h2>

          <h3>  <b>This is just a practice website, i will further be developing this into something more professional as a progress into my coding career, stay tuned to check out</b> </h3>

           <h3> The Best possible way to get onto the Darkweb is really simple. All you need is a few tools to help you log on. 
            <br> <br> <br> <br>
            Firstly you need to download TorBrowser, this enables you to surf the <b>REAL</b> internet. Most of you probably don't know but internet browsers like Google, Yahoo, Internet explorer
            all have restrictions on certain stuff you search on the browser, what TorBrowser essentially does is that it lets you see all corners of the internet. Ofcourse this comes with the <b>Good</b>
            and the <b>Bad</b> so be warned. <br>
            I also DO NOT take any responsibility for the missuse of TorBrowser by any of my students. <a href=https://www.techspot.com/downloads/5183-tor-browser.html >Click <b>HERE</b> for the TorBrowser link.</a> </h3>

            <h3>  Secondly you will need to get your self a VPN. VPN stands for "Virtual Private Network." In the easiest possible way to explain is that all internet boxes at home just like your
              house have an <b>Address</b>. So if someone is browsing the internet with out a VPN your IP Adress is exposed and if someone gets your IP Adress/ Internet box address they essentially
              know where you are located. Having a VPN <b>Allows</b> you to disconnect from your IP Address and connect to another persons IP Address. For example China banned the use of <b>Youtube</b>
              and <b>Facebook</b> so for the people of China to be able to connect to them apps they need to use a VPN and connect to another country's IP Adress like <b>America</b>which allows you to use banned apps/programmes
              while still being in China. My favourite VPN to use is NordVpn but if you want to find a free VPN you can also do that by searching the Chrome store. <a href= https://nordvpn.com/offer/brand-fastestvpn/?gclid=CjwKCAiApOvwBRBUEiwAcZGdGHQZ3al5hx-XKdJr673x4eWAOoUR3w_R-EHW6M4Fi39_qJjksNsnbBoCcpEQAvD_BwE&utm_expid=.SPqHVKB0Rxuh4-uawgvoaQ.1&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F>Click <b>HERE</b> for NordVPN link.</a>  </h3>

        <H2>WELL DONE</H2>

            You can finally surf the Internet <B>SAFELY</B> & <B>DISCRETELY</B>
